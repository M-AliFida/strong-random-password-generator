# Strong and Random Password Generator

This programme generates a strong, random password. The password is a combination of words, numbers and special characters. The password generator makes use of the **secrets** Python module. 

You can learn more about the secrets module [here:](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)

TL;DR: the secrets module can be used to generate 'cryptographically strong random numbers'. How exactly? It's a *secret* ;).

The code is full of comments which (hopefully!) clarify the code.
